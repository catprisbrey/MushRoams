# MushRoams
 A trippy third person adventure platformer

# Summary
A strange fog has rolled into town that has caused an illness to spread across the village. The only way to save the town to make a big stew! It's your job to help Mush roam the wilderness collecting mushrooms to add to the pot. Some mushrooms are Tasty and some are Trippy you'll have to give them a lick to find out which is which - and how they effect you. Harvest as many as you can to meet the day's quota, but try not to trip on anything or lose your balance! Good luck! The town is counting on you and this stew!
Controls

We recommend using a controller for the best experience but a keyboard works too.


# About

Mush Roams is the first project by a tandem bike. This is the demo version of something we'd like to build out much further. Your comments and welcome and appreciated! Hope you enjoy, Thanks!
